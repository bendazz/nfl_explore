This directory contains individual team files split from the main play-by-play dataset.
Each file contains all plays from games where that team participated (both home and away games).

## File Naming Convention
Files are named: `{TEAM_ABBR}_{TEAM_NICKNAME}_2024.csv`

## Additional Columns Added
Each team file includes these extra columns for convenience:
- `team_full_name`: Official team name
- `team_nickname`: Team nickname/mascot
- `team_conference`: AFC or NFC
- `team_division`: Division within conference

## Available Team Files

## Usage Tips

1. **Start with one team**: Pick your favorite team or a team with interesting storylines
2. **Compare divisions**: Use teams from the same division for comparative analysis
3. **Conference analysis**: Compare AFC vs NFC teams
4. **File size**: Each team file is much smaller and more manageable than the full dataset
5. **Join with roster data**: Use the main players_2024.csv file to add player information

## Example Analysis Ideas

- Analyze your team's offensive efficiency by quarter
- Compare home vs away performance
- Study red zone efficiency
- Track key players' contributions throughout the season
- Examine how your team performs in close games

Happy analyzing! üèà
